I am a PhD candidate in linguistics at The Unversity of Queensland, Australia. I specialise in computational historical linguistics. Research focuses include computational linguistics, quantitative methods (Bayesian statistical approaches, big data, MCMC), phonology (quantitative and computational approaches), phylogenetic methods, Australian Indigenous languages.

My thesis (currently under examination) is titled _Phonotactics in historical linguistics: Quantitative interrogation of a novel data source_. I hope to have it finalised and released publicly in the first half of 2021.
