## Research

I am a PhD candidate in linguistics at The Unversity of Queensland, Australia. My research develops computational approaches to historical linguistics and language comparison. My fields of specialty include computational linguistics, quantitative methods (Bayesian statistical approaches, big data, MCMC), phonology (quantitative and computational approaches), phylogenetic methods, Australian Indigenous languages.

I'm particularly interested in the application of computational language sciences to under-resourced languages. This can help broaden accessibility of speech and language technologies to under-served linguistic communities. Studying a broad cross-section of the globe's linguistic diversity is also crucial for answering some of the biggest questions in linguistics and human history.

My thesis (currently under examination) is titled _Phonotactics in historical linguistics: Quantitative interrogation of a novel data source_. I hope to have it finalised and released publicly in the first half of 2021. In the meantime, a couple of the chapters have been published already as journal articles (see Publications, above).

## Data science

My skills cover the full data science pipeline, including data curation, methodological design, advanced statistical programming in R and other software, technical reporting, visualisation and presentation. I have project management experience, including winning grant funding, managing teams of research assistants and publishing in leading international journals.

I am currently seeking opportunities to put my data science skills to good use. I get tremendous satisfaction from generating new insights and I look forward to taking my experience and applying the statistical knowledge I've gained to novel challenges.

If you or your business has some data that needs analysing, or you're interested in exploring the possibilities for improving your analytic practices (do you currently spend a lot of time on a boring, repetitive task? Maybe I can automate that for you!), I'm keen to hear from you. Please get in touch!
