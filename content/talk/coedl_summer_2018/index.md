In November, I'll be attending CoEDL's Summer School for 2018. I believe I'll be giving a short presentation in the course _Visualizing Language Data for Analysis and Communication_ ([Lydia Byrne](http://www.visualizationwhiteboard.com/)) on my strategies for visualising phylogenetic signal in phonotactic characters. I'm also greatly looking forward to the course _Machines can do the work, can't they? Machine Learning for linguists_ by [Daan van Esch](https://ai.google/research/people/DaanvanEsch) and guests.
