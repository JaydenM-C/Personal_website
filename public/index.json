As automated analyses using large-scale cross-linguistic databases (for example, Blasi et al., 2016) become more popular, typology becomes ever more sensitive to decisions made about how linguistic data is coded. Relatedly, challenges present themselves when expanding quantitative techniques from pilot studies to larger domains. Here I discuss such challenges and compare two kinds of solutions for the case of a recent methodological advance in phonological typology, arguing against one widely used approach based on data impoverishment, in favour of a novel, data-rich approach.\n \n I first recap a quantitative method for investigating the phonotactic typology of Australian languages, which can generate several hundred characters (i.e., variables) per language (Macklin-Cordes \u0026 Round, 2015). The phonotactics of languages may be compared, in the simplest case, in terms of which sequences of segments each language permits or does not permit, and this kind of data is often provided in descriptive grammars (Fig. 1). On these terms, Australian languages have been described as notably homogenous in their phonotactic systems (Hamilton, 1996), as in their phonological systems more generally (Dixon, 1980; Baker, 2014). However, Gasser \u0026 Bowern (2014) demonstrate that greater diversity among phonological inventories of Australian languages emerges when matters of frequency are considered. We extended this idea to phonotactics. For all possible two-segment sequences in a language, we calculate the frequency of the occurrence of a+b relative to all sequences of a+X in the language’s vocabulary. This yields an n×n matrix of continuous characters for each language (Fig. 2). These data can be compared between languages and even form the basis for diachronic investigation. A case study examining two Pama-Nyungan subgroups, Yolngu and Ngumpin-Yapa, found evidence of phylogenetic signal across continuous phonotactic characters, extracted as per the method described here; that is, variation among the data fits the hypothesis that the data evolved along an independently derived phylogeny (from Bowern \u0026 Atkinson, 2012).\n \n These tentative findings make us optimistic that our avenue of methodological development may drive future insight in typology and historical linguistics. However, expansion to areas with a relatively high diversity of segment types is a challenge. Non-trivial data-processing decisions must be made, since two-segment sequences may only be compared between languages when both segments are considered shared between the languages in question. A large diversity of segment types will therefore result in too sparse a dataset, where mismatches between languages occur. I compare two approaches which respond to this problem, in the context of expanding our proof-of- concept to the rest of Sahul, the continent of Australia and New Guinea: The first approach is that of the Automated Similarity Judgement Program (ASJP; Wichmann et al., 2016) and subsequently used in several large-scale comparative studies (Blasi et al., 2016; Holman et al., 2011), which is to bin segments into broader segment classes (for example, an ‘N’ bin for all nasal consonants). The second approach is to break up segments into their constituent features. I present evidence which favours the second approach. The first approach results in information loss and can introduce biases into the data (Macklin-Cordes, Moran \u0026 Round, 2016). In contrast, the second approach enables a rich level of phonological diversity to be represented in a commensurate fashion, while maintaining a large enough collection of characters for data-hungry statistical algorithms.\n \n Phonological typology is as sensitive as ever to how data is coded. In the face of upscaling challenges, I present one methodological pathway for comparing high-definition phonotactics over the diverse macro-area of Sahul.","tags":["Phylogenetic signal","Phylogenetic comparative methods","Phonotactics","Pama-Nyungan","Linguistic typology","ALT"],"title":"High-definition phonotactic typology in Sahul: Choosing the data-rich approach","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Jayden L.

Nevertheless, we could soon be able to query the entire store of published knowledge on human languages when we do our research. To do so, knowledge must be represented in a machine-readable format. Here, we introduce a prototype ‘Grammar Harvester’, a set of processes for creating richly annotated, machine-readable versions of existing grammatical descriptions, starting from a scanned PDF. Further, we introduce ‘Finder’ and ‘Analyser’ Robots, scripts which automatically identify and compile information from harvested grammars using novel and existing ontologies of linguistic concepts. \n \n **Author Bio** \n \n Jayden Macklin-Cordes is a PhD candidate at the Ancient Language Lab, University of Queensland.

However, there has been less development of the kinds of data used with these methods. Computational phylogenetic studies (e.g. Bouckaert, Bowern, and Atkinson 2018; Kolipakam et al. 2018) tend to rely on lexical data consisting of expert, manually-coded cognate judgements. This is a rate-determining step and a barrier where language documentation is limited (notwithstanding progress by List et al. 2018). \n \n Phylogenetic comparative methods can be used to identify and quantify historical patterns in comparative datasets. It is possible to empirically test whether novel kinds of linguistic data accord with known phylogenetic histories of languages (phylogenetic signal) and therefore contain information of interest to historical linguistic inquiry. Recent work (Macklin-Cordes, Round \u0026 Bowern, submitted) considers statistical phonotactic data using this approach. Phylogenetic signal is found in variables coding the frequencies of transitions from segment $x$ to segment $y$ in the sequence $xy$ relativized over all instances of $x$, extracted from wordlists and compared to an independent reference phylogeny inferred using lexical cognate data. In addition, a higher degree of phylogenetic signal is found in relative frequencies of transitions between natural sound classes. There are two limitations, however: (1) Statistics for quantifying phylogenetic signal require large datasets, becoming unstable with fewer than 40 languages. (2) Phylogenetic signal is quantified for each variable individually, which does not directly test the question of whether a language’s overall phonotactic system contains historical information more generally. \n \n In this study, we address both limitations by estimating the level of phylogenetic signal for whole phonotactic datasets using a multivariate version of the $K$ statistic (Blomberg, Garland, and Ives 2003), $K{mult}$ (Adams 2014). This method collapses a multivariate dataset into a matrix of Euclidean distances between languages and compares those distances to the phylogenetic distances between languages in a reference tree. We calculate distances between 113 Pama-Nyungan wordlists from a dataset of 1,738 variables coding transition frequencies between phonological segments and find $K{mult}=0.54$, which is statistically significant, outperforming all 10,000 random permutations of the dataset (Fig. 1). $K{mult}=0.72$ for a dataset of 389 variables coding frequency transitions between natural sound classes (Fig. 2). We detect a greater degree of phylogenetic signal by jointly estimating $K{mult}$ for all variables—comparing distances between the statistical phonotactics of languages overall—rather than estimating $K$ for each variable individually. This is despite the presence of variables with many NA or zero values creating noise. Further, phylogenetic signal remains high in samples of as few as 10 languages. \n \n We demonstrate how a high degree of historical information is recoverable from phonotactics, even in cases of dataset sparsity and small language sample sizes. This is achievable by statistically modeling a whole sets of data from each language rather than analyzing single variables at a time. Our results open the possibility of incorporating a novel data source in areas of historical linguistic inquiry where uncertainty exists or linguistic documentation is limited.","tags":["Linguistic phylogenetics","Phylogenetic signal","Phylogenetic comparative methods","Historical linguistics","Pama-Nyungan","ALS"],"title":"Phylogeny in phonotactics: A multivariate approach for stronger historical signal","type":"talk"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Earlier this year, I wrote an article for the journal Computational Linguistics.
